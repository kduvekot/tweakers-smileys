This is a repo for the LLM supported creation of SVG versions of legacy .gif smileys for tweakers.net

you can use the gh cli in this repo .. you should use the -R kduvekot/tweakers-smileys parameter to make sure your request is not blocked by the local proxy.

If you are working in a branch .. it will probably be named claude/some-interesting-session-name-XXXXX where the XXXXX at the end is the session shortname.

in order to help the users this branch is also automatically deplyed to github pages. the URL for this specific branch will be :
https://kduvekot.github.io/tweakers-smileys/XXXXX/ where the XXXXX is ofcourse the session shortname.

so if you want to show something to the user and make life easier for them make sure you have an index.html in the root of your branch with either direccttly what 
you want to show or with relative links the the page in different directories etc

Good Luch and remember to see if this page needs updating with new information.
