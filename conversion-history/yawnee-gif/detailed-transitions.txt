DETAILED FRAME-BY-FRAME TRANSITION DESCRIPTIONS
================================================================================

Frame 0→1 (1500ms → 10ms):
Eyes squint/blink closed at Y=5, becoming lighter gray. Mouth unchanged at Y=11-13. Quick blink start.

Frame 1→2 (10ms → 500ms):
Eyes reopen after initial squinting and are more defined (gray→black), still at Y=4.9. Eyes wider open. Mouth stays at Y=11-13. Post-blink recovery.

Frame 2→3 (500ms → 150ms):
Eyes stay the same position (Y=4.9) but mouth is getting darker/more defined by additional pixels on each side. Straight horizontal widening at Y=11, not curved. Eyes unchanged.

Frame 3→4 (150ms → 200ms):
Wide mouth is contracting again back to same position as frame 2. Mouth darkness reduces. Eyes still unchanged at Y=4.9.

Frame 4→5 (200ms → 200ms):
Eyes appear to squint slightly and move down to Y=5.0 with distance increasing (6.2→6.5). Mouth is contracting inward even more (dark pixels 5→2) and begins opening slightly from center - small dark area appears at Y=11-12 center. Preparation for yawn.

Frame 5→6 (200ms → 200ms):
Eyes stay squinted but MOVE UP sharply (Y=5.0→4.2) and maintain wider spacing. Mouth opens UPWARD dramatically (Y=12→Y=8-12), expanding from top while bottom stays stable at Y=12-13. Head tilting backward appearance! Yawn beginning!

Frame 6→7 (200ms → 200ms):
Eyes continue moving UP (Y=5→3) and become VERY DARK (values→0, solid black). Distance decreases (5→4 pixels), eyes coming closer. Mouth FULLY OPENS - massive expansion upward to Y=3-7, dark pixels jump from 11→many. Wide-open yawn expression achieved!

Frame 7→8 (200ms → 250ms):
Eyes CONTINUE MOVING UP (Y=3→2) and move FURTHER APART (4→5 pixels), becoming lighter gray (0→68, squinting). Mouth stays wide open and expands even more. Yawn reaches maximum upward stretch!

Frame 8→9 (250ms → 250ms):
Eyes move DOWN slightly (Y=2.0→2.7) and CLOSER together (5→4 pixels), becoming DARKER/more open (68→24, black). Mouth DARKENS. Trembling oscillation starts - eyes opening wider, coming closer.

Frame 9→10 (250ms → 250ms):
Eyes move UP (Y=2.7→2.0) and APART (4→5 pixels), SQUINTING (24→68, gray). Mouth lightens. Trembling alternation - open↔squint pattern.

Frame 10→11 (250ms → 250ms):
Eyes move DOWN (Y=2.0→2.7) and CLOSER (5→4 pixels), opening to BLACK (68→24). Mouth darkens. Pattern repeats - sustained yawn peak vibration.

Frame 11→12 (250ms → 250ms):
Eyes move UP (Y=2.7→2.0) and APART (4→5 pixels), SQUINTING (24→68, gray). Mouth lightens. Alternating trembling continues.

Frame 12→13 (250ms → 250ms):
Eyes move DOWN (Y=2.0→2.7) and CLOSER (5→4 pixels), opening to BLACK (68→24). Mouth darkens. Repeating trembling cycle.

Frame 13→14 (250ms → 250ms):
Eyes move UP (Y=2.7→2.0) and APART (4→5 pixels), SQUINTING (24→68, gray). Mouth lightens. Continuous oscillation.

Frame 14→15 (250ms → 250ms):
Eyes move DOWN (Y=2.0→2.7) and CLOSER (5→4 pixels), opening to BLACK (68→24). Mouth darkens. Sustained yawn strain pattern.

Frame 15→16 (250ms → 250ms):
Eyes move UP (Y=2.7→2.0) and APART (4→5 pixels), SQUINTING (24→68, gray). Mouth lightens. Trembling persists.

Frame 16→17 (250ms → 250ms):
Eyes move DOWN (Y=2.0→2.7) and CLOSER (5→4 pixels), opening to BLACK (68→24). Mouth darkens. Pattern continues.

Frame 17→18 (250ms → 250ms):
Eyes move UP (Y=2.7→2.0) and APART (4→5 pixels), SQUINTING (24→68, gray). Mouth lightens. Still trembling.

Frame 18→19 (250ms → 250ms):
Eyes move DOWN (Y=2.0→2.7) and CLOSER (5→4 pixels), opening to BLACK (68→24). Mouth darkens. Oscillation continues.

Frame 19→20 (250ms → 250ms):
Eyes move UP (Y=2.7→2.0) and APART (4→5 pixels), SQUINTING (24→68, gray). Mouth lightens. Penultimate trembling cycle.

Frame 20→21 (250ms → 300ms):
Eyes move DOWN (Y=2.0→2.7) and CLOSER (5→4 pixels), opening to BLACK (68→24). Mouth darkens. FINAL yawn peak trembling cycle. Longest single frame duration (300ms).

Frame 21→22 (300ms → 100ms):
YAWN ENDING! Eyes JUMP UP dramatically (Y=4.6→3.5) and squint to gray. Distance widens back (5.9→6.5), eyes move apart. Mouth CONTRACTS massively - top drops from Y=8 to Y=9, dark pixels collapse (30→8). Major transition! Quick 100ms.

Frame 22→23 (100ms → 10ms):
Eyes move down slightly (Y=3.5→4.2), stay squinted gray. Mouth top rises back to Y=8 but much lighter (8→2 dark pixels). Recovery phase starting. Ultra-quick 10ms transition.

Frame 23→24 (10ms → 250ms):
Eyes position stable (Y=4.2), stay squinted. Mouth alternates: top drops to Y=9, slightly darker (2→5 dark pixels). Quick blink/alternation pattern begins.

Frame 24→25 (250ms → 10ms):
Eyes stable Y=4.2. Mouth top rises to Y=8, lighter again (5→2 pixels). Alternating mouth pattern. Quick 10ms.

Frame 25→26 (10ms → 250ms):
Eyes stable Y=4.2. Mouth drops to Y=9, darker (2→5 pixels). Alternation continues. Longer hold.

Frame 26→27 (250ms → 10ms):
Eyes stable Y=4.2. Mouth rises to Y=8, lighter (5→2 pixels). Pattern persisting. Quick transition.

Frame 27→28 (10ms → 250ms):
Eyes stable Y=4.2. Mouth drops to Y=9, darker (2→5 pixels). Final alternation cycle.

Frame 28→0 (250ms → 1500ms):
Eyes stable at Y=4.2 squinted. Mouth gradually settles down toward Y=11-12 (center 10.9→12.0), returning to smile position. LOOP COMPLETE - ready for next yawn! Long 1500ms pause before restart.
