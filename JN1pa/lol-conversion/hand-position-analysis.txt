Current LoL SVG Positioning Analysis (34×16px canvas):

Face:
- Group: translate(9,0)
- Circle: cx="8" cy="8" r="7.9"
- Actual face center in canvas: x=17 (9+8)

Left Hand (STATIC at lowest):
- Group: translate(1,13)
- Hand shape spans ~0 to 8 in local coords
- Canvas position: x=1 to x=9
- Distance from face center (x=17) to hand's nearest edge (x=9): 8px

Right Hand (ANIMATED):
- Outer group: translate(25,0)
- Hand shape spans ~0 to 8 in local coords
- Canvas position: x=25 to x=33
- Distance from face center (x=17) to hand's nearest edge (x=25): 8px

Both hands appear equidistant from the face center (8px gap on each side).

When animated, the right hand moves vertically (translate(0,Y)) but stays at x=25 horizontally.
